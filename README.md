# Holberton School - Shell

This repository contains solutions to the Shell project tasks from Holberton School.  

Each directory corresponds to a project covering different aspects of shell scripting:

- **basics** → Introduction to basic shell commands  

- **permissions** → File permissions and ownership  

- **io_redirections_and_filters** → I/O redirections and filters  

- **init_files_variables_and_expansions** → Initialization files, variables, and expansions  

All scripts are executable and start with the proper shebang
